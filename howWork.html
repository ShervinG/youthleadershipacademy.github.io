                        The Youth Leadership Academy is being built through the efforts of CCA's Better Tomorrow Club, which debates and discusses various topics. As an organization, the leaders hoped that they could create an environment to aid the development of a culturally diversified curriculum by acting as a helping hand to existing clubs through their voluntary participation. They gained insight from potential cultural clubs on how they would like the program to be structured, created dependable structures, and discussed the purposes of each of its members.

                        The Youth Leadership Academy aims to aid the cultural diversification of curriculums throughout San Diego County. To do this, each school district participating in the program will have 3 representatives. These representatives will keep tabs with all participating clubs and, during weekly meetings, will meet with the associated clubs of a particular culture or subgroup in order for them to share information and request resources. Additionally, monthly meetings will consist of representatives from all districts in which they will discuss any district-specific updates, provide resources to clubs, and connect these clubs with others that can provide them with these resources. Throughout this entire process, educators and teachers will be encouraged to participate in such meetings.

                                If any club or organization plans to present on a certain topic, for example a misconception in regards to their culture or social identity, the club will present on their topic first and then a discussion portion is held with Q/A.
